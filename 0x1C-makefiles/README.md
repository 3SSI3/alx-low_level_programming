# C- Makefiles
The *make* utility is a software tool for managing and maintaining
computer programs consisting many component files. The make utility
automatically determines which pieces of a large program need to be
recompiled, and issues commands to recompile them.

__Makefile__ is a set of commands (similar to terminal commands) with variable names and targets to create object file and to remove them

 ### RULES ðŸ§­       
- **clean** (deletes Emacs & vim temp files along with exectuable)
- **oclean** (deletes the objects files)
- **fclean** (deletes all Emacs & vim temp files, the executable and the obj files
- **re** (forces recompilation of all source files

### VARIABLES ðŸ§­:
- **CC**: the compiler to be used
- **SRC**: the .c files
- **OBJ**: the .o files
- **NAME**: the name of the executable
- **RM**: the program to delete files
